        <p>All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE) has identified nine emerging areas in engineering in this academic year to cope up with the emerging industrial demands, as per Industry 4.0 standards, which requires smart systems development for better man machine interface. These areas are Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things (IoT), Block Chain, Robotics, Quantum Computing, Data Science, Cyber Security, 3D Printing Design and Virtual Reality (VR). We are very proud to say that VESIT faculty and students have already been concentrating on these emerging areas and worked on 40 projects of Machine learning, 22 projects on Deep Learning, 32 projects on IoT, and 7 projects on Robotics during the last academic year.</p>
        <p>We are also very happy to report that the project titled “New Hardware Methods for Extraction of Low Level Differential Signals over Wide Bandwidth with High CMRR and S/N Ratio” by Mrs. Nilima Warke, Instrumentation Dept. was selected by Nehru Science Centre as “Innovative Idea and Design Project”. VESIT is proud of our faculty members of VESIT Renaissance Cell who have developed need based technology solutions for the Institute such as Content Management System, RFID systems in library, Leaving Certificate module; Railway Concession Assistance software and Admission software teaching aid system by Electronics Dept. faculty. All these projects are indication of the capability of our staff to provide customized innovative solutions to real problems. We hope that the success of these projects will motivate other staff members to also concentrate in this direction. We are also proud of our faculty members who have filed patents for the research work.</p>
        <p>We are happy to report that student teams from Computer and IT departments are working on projects in Artificial Intelligence (AI) for societal problems under the guidance of their Department teachers, using Compute Grants from Microsoft Azure worth 45,000 US Dollars. Computer Dept. also received a sponsorship of Rs. 75,000/- from Github for conducting technical hackathon and an event for women safety.</p>
        <p>This year Dept. of Information Technology faculty proposed an IT based solution for operations and maintenance of community based toilets and Public Toilets in the city of Mumbai in collaboration with Community Based Organization (CBO) and MCGM. A research Project titled “Development of Methodology for Indian Evaluated Nuclear Data Library for Application in S & T” has received sanction of a total grant of Rs. 17.81 lakh from Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), Govt. of India, based on recommendations of Board of Research in Nuclear Science (BRNS) with Dr. (Mrs.) J. M. Nair as Principal Investigator (PI) and Mrs. Sangeetha Prasanna Ram, as Co-PI.</p>
        <p>Our institute has also been awarded a trophy by Mayor, Navi Mumbai for completing the river cleaning robot project sponsored by NMMC. This project was carried out by EXTC students under the guidance of Prof. Dr. Nadir Charniya.</p>
        <p>Another feather in our cap was the four star rating for the Institute’s Innovation Council (IIC), the primary aim of which is to acquaint students with the importance of innovation. This year VESIT signed an MOU with Aditya Jyot Foundation for doing collaborative research work in the area of ophthalmology. Two project groups under the faculty members are already working in this direction. A lecture by Dr. Rich Fletcher, Research Scientist, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Design Labs, USA, on “Machine Learning and Healthcare” and a lecture by Dr. Srujama Cera, University of Melbourne on “Machine Learning for Biomedical Applications” was conducted in our institute in collaboration with Aditya Jyot for the benefit of students.</p>
        <p>A 30 Hour Hackathon titled VESIT Hacks was conducted in Praxis’19-VESIT’s annual TechFest, was held on 22nd – 23rd September, 2019. The event conducted by VESIT Renaissance Cell was a huge success with participation of 285 students. Every year our students participate in the Smart India Hackathon conducted by AICTE. This year, four teams from VESIT have been selected for the final event to be held during the first week of the April.</p>
